# CSOQaQc
CSO Data Quality Assessment

This is where I will be posting much of my work I do on the CSO project for my Internship with LSAMP at the APL.

In this `README` I'll provide context for each file pushed to this repository.

## Environment File:
  * `cso_obsdata_environment.yml`

This is the environment file for all of the notebooks and code that I will be pushing. It will always be up to date if I add anymore packages.

## Raw CSO Data:
  * `CSOgeodata.geojson`
  * `CSO_CA.geojson`
  * `CSO_UT.geojson`
  * `CSO_AL.geojson`

These txt files containing the raw CSO data. They are needed to run many of the Notebooks. `CSOgeodata.geojson` is the entire CSO data set pulled from the database on June 28th, 2021, this however cannot be publicly avaialbe. `CSO_CA.geojson`, `CSO_UT.geojson` and `CSO_AL.geojson` are region specific CSO data sets for California, Utah and Alaska respectively.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
  * `CSOQaQcSPRING.ipynb`
  * `CSOZeros.ipynb`
  * `CSOLARGE.ipynb`
  * `CSOAlaska.ipynb`
  * `CSOAnalysis.ipynb`

These are the notebooks that I have been maintaining and using throughout this internship and research opportunity. `CSOQaQcSPRING` is the main notebook I used to experiment and get comfortable with the data. It is outdated and very rough. All other notebooks come from the work I did during the Summer of 2021.

## Other Files:
 * `ToDo.md`

This a simply a mark down to-do list that I will keep updating as I learn more. It will also serve as a way for me to jot down ideas and discussions from meetings.
